**My hack idea**
> What's the idea?
- Make recommendations to a user for songs similar to song's he/she has recently Shazamed. These songs could be similar in multiple ways. E.g. there is another song in the same album. Or perhaps a new album has recently been released by the same artist - recommend the new album to the user.

- Make recommendations to a user for popular songs he/she may be interested in. Popularity may be judged according to a number of criteria: e.g. number of Shazams people in his locality have made for that song; number of Shazam's for UK residents that week; number of Shazams in the past 24 hours worldwide; etc. 

> What's the minimum viable product you can create?
- Recommend most tagged song in the last 24 hours worldwide that is in the same album as song the user tagged.

**Resouces I'll use**
> You are required either to use a MusicKit API or data provided of Shazams that users have created. What are you going to use?

Both:
- Tag samples
- MusicKit API	

> In addition to the above, what other resources are you going to use?
As of now, no other resources are foreseen to be needed.

**Language(s) I'll use**
> This will help us idenfity who can help you from the team for your hack.
Python will be used.
